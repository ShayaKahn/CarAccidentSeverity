### Target
| Target | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Severity | Shows the severity of the accident, a number between 1 and 4, where 1 indicates the least impact on traffic (i.e., short delay as a result of the accident) and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic (i.e., long delay). |

## Goal and methods
The goal is to predict the "Severity" of the accident. I used the classification algorithms: Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost and artificial neural network.
This data set contains categorical, numerical, and boolean features.

There are several methods I will try to compare to deal with the imbalanced dataset. The methods are:

1. Random Under Sampling
2. Random Over Sampling
3. SMOTE Oversampling

### Notes:
- Before applying oversampling, I applied undersampling since the dataset has become very large.

## Evaluation metrics

I chose to use the macro-averaged F1 score to evaluate the performance of the models.

## Model Performance Comparison

| Resampling Method       | Random Forest | XGBoost |
|-------------------------|--------------|---------|
| Random Under Sampling  | 0.53         | 0.55    |
| Random Over Sampling   | 0.56         | 0.59    |
| SMOTE Over Sampling    | 0.56         | 0.58    |

## Conclusion

In this project, I analyzed the US_Accidents_Dec21_updated dataset to predict accident severity. I developed a preprocessing pipeline that normalizes features, encodes categorical variables, removes outliers, and engineers new features. Since the data is highly imbalanced, I experimented with three resampling techniques (random under-sampling, random over-sampling, and SMOTE) and compared Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers. To find optimal hyperparameters, I performed a randomized search using 50,000 training samples and five-fold cross-validation.

Among the tested configurations, XGBoost with random over-sampling gave the best performance. I suspect random under-sampling performed poorly due to significant data loss, while SMOTE struggled in high-dimensional space.

Next, I trained the best model (XGBoost with random over-sampling) using 1.5 million samples. The final macro-averaged F1 score reached 0.73, which is promising given the strong imbalance in the dataset. I then studied how increasing the number of training samples affects precision and recall for each severity class. The minority classes saw a drop in recall (indicating more false negatives), likely due to partial overfitting to the majority class, whereas precision improved for minority classes because of fewer false positives. Overall, the macro-averaged F1 score improved for all classes. I chose the macro F1 metric to balance precision and recall across classes.

Lastly, I attempted to use XGBoost with Dask on my local machine (an i7-1255U). Because the dataset fits comfortably into memory and I only have a single processor, I observed no performance benefitsâ€”distributing the workload added scheduling overhead without providing additional compute resources.
